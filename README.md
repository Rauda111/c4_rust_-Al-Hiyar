# C4 Rust Compiler

## Project Overview & Objectives

This project is a Rust reimplementation of the original C4 compiler a minimal C compiler that supports a small subset of the C language. The objectives of this project are:

- **Rewriting the C4 Compiler in Rust:**  
  Translate the C4 compiler (lexer, parser, virtual machine, etc.) from C into Rust while preserving functional equivalence and ensuring self-hosting capability.
  
- **Leveraging Rust Features:**  
  Use Rust idioms (ownership, pattern matching, error handling with `Result`/`Option`) to improve safety, clarity, and maintainability.
  
- **Implementing Unit Testing & Documentation:**  
  Provide comprehensive tests for each component and detailed documentation for future maintainers.
  
- **Bonus Feature – Floating‑Point Support:**  
  Extend the compiler to support floating‑point literals and arithmetic in addition to the original C subset.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

c4_rust_-Al-Hiyar (GitHub repository name)

├── Cargo.toml (Cargo configuration (file Main Rust source file implementing the compiler)



├── c4.rs (Main Rust source file implementing the compiler)


├── c4 +bonus.rs (Rust source file implementing the compiler (includes bonus floating‑point support))


├── README.md (This file)


└── c4_rust_comparison.pdf (Comparison report between the Rust implementation and the original C4 compiler)


## Building the Project

To build the project, run the following command in the repository directory:

```bash
cargo build
   ```
This command will compile your Rust source code and produce an executable.

## Running the Compiler

To run the compiler on a C source file (e.g., sample.c), use the following command:

```bash
cargo run -- sample.c
 ```

The compiler will:

- Read and tokenize the provided C source code.

- Parse the tokens into opcodes.

- Execute the opcodes using a stack-based virtual machine.

- Print the result of the program or any errors encountered during lexing, parsing, or execution.

## Running Unit Tests

Unit tests are provided for the lexer, parser, and virtual machine components. To run all tests, execute:

```bash
cargo test
```

Ensure all tests pass to verify that the compiler processes the supported subset of C correctly, including the bonus floating‑point functionality.




# Bonus Feature: Floating‑Point Support

## Overview

In addition to supporting the original C subset (integers, basic arithmetic, control flow, and self-hosting), this compiler includes bonus support for floating‑point numbers. The bonus feature enables the compiler to:

- Recognize floating‑point literals (e.g., 3.14, 0.001) during lexing.

- Generate appropriate opcodes (FImm) for floating‑point immediates in the parser.

- Perform floating‑point arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in the virtual machine with proper type checking.

## How to Test/Use Floating‑Point Support

You can test floating‑point support by providing a C source file containing floating‑point expressions. For example, create a file float_test.c with the following content:
```bash
int main() {
    return 3.14 + 2.0;
}
```
Run the compiler with:

```bash
cargo run -- float_test.c
```
The expected output should show that the program executed successfully and returned the result of the floating‑point arithmetic.


# Self-Hosting Demonstration 

This compiler is designed to be self-hosting—that is, it should be able to compile its own source code. To test this property, try compiling the compiler’s own source file. For example:

```bash
cargo run -- c4.rs
```
If the compiler successfully compiles its own source code and produces the expected output, then the self-hosting capability is verified.

 # Additional Documentation
 
- **Rust Documentation:**
  
The source code is fully documented using Rust doc comments. To generate HTML documentation, run:

```bash
cargo doc --open
```
- **Comparison Report:**

The file c4_rust_comparison.pdf provides an in-depth comparison between this Rust implementation and the original C4 compiler, including design decisions, performance insights, and challenges encountered during the rewrite.

# Collaboration and GitHub Workflow

- **Repository Name:**  
  The GitHub repository is named `c4_rust_-Al-Hiyar`.

- **Commit History:**  
  Both team members, **Rauda** and **Almaha**, have contributed equally to the project. Each commit message clearly indicates individual work on major features. For example:
  - "Rauda: Implemented lexer"
  - "Almaha: Added floating‑point support"
  - "Rauda: Fixed VM instruction parsing"

- **Branching and Pull Requests:**  
  Features and bug fixes have been developed on separate branches and merged via pull requests to facilitate code review and collaboration.

##  Testing Instructions

This project includes a suite of inline unit tests to validate the compiler's behavior across different scenarios:

### ✔ Covered Test Cases:
- `test_nested_if_else`: Verifies correct control flow handling for nested if–else constructs.
- `test_nested_while_loops`: Checks the behavior of nested loops and variable mutation.
- `test_undefined_variable_error`: Confirms that the parser raises errors for undeclared variables.
- `test_division_by_zero_error`: Ensures runtime safety with division by zero detection.
- `test_invalid_syntax_error`: Validates the parser catches syntax errors.
- `test_self_hosting`: Simulates a minimal self-hosting test with `int main() { return 42; }`.

###  How to Run Tests
Run the following command in the root of the project:
```bash
cargo test
```

###  Recommended: Generate Code Coverage (Optional)
To check test coverage, you can install and run `cargo tarpaulin`:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin
```

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates a self-hosting C compiler implemented in Rust with enhanced safety, maintainability, and a bonus feature for floating‑point support. Follow the instructions above to build, run, and test the compiler. For further details, please refer to the in-code documentation and the comparison report.

> **Note:** This project is based on the original [`c4.c`](./c4.c) C source file provided in the project requirements. It served as the reference implementation for translating the compiler logic into Rust.
